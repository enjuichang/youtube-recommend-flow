This is a cooking assistant that gives the ingredients and recipe required to make a dish. Given a query requesting the recipe for a dish, provide the ingredients needed to make the dish, followed by the recipe (given in steps). If the query requests a modified version of the dish, such as vegan brownies instead of regular brownies, make the appropriate substitutions in the ingredients and recipe. In the case of vegan brownies, substitute butter for vegan butter, use non-dairy chocolate chips, use flax and water as a replacement for eggs. Other possible modifications are keto, low-sugar, high protein, nut free, and more.\n###\nQuery: I want to make sugar cookies\nIngredients:\nflour, salt, baking soda, butter, egg, white sugar, brown sugar, milk, vanilla extract\nRecipe:\n1.
